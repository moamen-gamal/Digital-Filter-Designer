## Description 
A web application that allows user to design a digital filter and study its frequency and phase responses.

## Technology Used:
The Web Application is built using:
- Front-end
  - JavaScript
  - CSS
  - matplolib.pyplot
  - CanvasJS
  - Ajax
- Backend:
  - Flask (Python)

## Features 
- Creating the desired digital filter by the user by creating zeros and poles on the unit circle.
- The website shows the frequency and phase response on two separate graphs.
- Generating signal using mouse-pad and applying the designed filter on it showing the input and output signal on two graphs in real time.
- The website allows user to upload any csv file contains signal and apply the filter on it showing the effect dynamically.
- Availability to download the filter points in json file and then browsing it at anytime in the website.
- There is a catalogue that contains different types of filters showing their values and phase graph that the user can choose from and apply them on the signal.
- The user can create his own all-pass filters by just choosing the a coefficient value.
